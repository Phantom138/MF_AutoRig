# MF Maya AutoRig Tool

A custom auto-rigging tool for Autodesk Maya 2022+, built to streamline the character rigging process with modular, flexible components.

## Installation

**Note:** This tool requires **PyMel**. You can find instructions for installing PyMel [here](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2026/ENU/?guid=GUID-2AA5EFCE-53B1-46A0-8E43-4CD0B2C72FB4).

To install the rigging tool:

1. Open your Maya scene.
2. Drag and drop the `drag_and_drop_install.py` file into the viewport.

## Work in Progress

This tool is under active development as I continue to refine my understanding of rigging workflows. It has been used in team projects and is evolving based on practical needs.

**Note:** Future updates may introduce breaking changes.
